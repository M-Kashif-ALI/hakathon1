# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Integration

Welcome to the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Integration module. This module focuses on integrating vision, language models, and robotic action for autonomous humanoids, covering end-to-end VLA workflows in simulation environments.

## Overview

This module covers the integration of three critical components for autonomous humanoid robots:

1. **Vision Systems**: Perception and understanding of the environment
2. **Language Models**: Processing natural language commands and generating action plans
3. **Action Execution**: Converting plans into physical robot behaviors

## Target Audience

This module is designed for AI, robotics, and software engineering students familiar with ROS 2 and simulation concepts.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Basic understanding of ROS 2
- Familiarity with simulation environments (Gazebo, Isaac Sim, or similar)
- Python knowledge for ROS 2 nodes
- Basic understanding of LLM concepts

## Chapters

This module is organized into three main chapters:

1. [Voice-to-Action Interfaces](./voice-to-action/) - Covering speech recognition with OpenAI Whisper and converting voice commands into structured inputs
2. [Cognitive Planning with LLMs](./cognitive-planning/) - Translating natural language tasks into action plans and mapping to ROS 2 behaviors
3. [Capstone: The Autonomous Humanoid](./autonomous-humanoid/) - End-to-end VLA pipeline with navigation, perception, and manipulation workflow

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand how to convert voice commands into structured robot actions
- Implement LLM-based task planning for robotic systems
- Integrate all VLA components into a complete autonomous humanoid system
- Explain the complete VLA system architecture
- Describe LLM-based planning for robots and its role in autonomous systems
- Understand the full autonomous humanoid pipeline
