# Chapter 2: Cognitive Planning with LLMs

This chapter covers the cognitive layer of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems: using Large Language Models to translate natural language tasks into executable action plans. You'll learn how to create robots that understand complex human instructions and generate appropriate action sequences.

## Overview

Cognitive planning with LLMs provides the reasoning and planning capabilities needed for autonomous robots. This chapter focuses on:

- Translating natural language tasks into action plans
- Mapping generated plans to ROS 2 behaviors
- Understanding LLM integration in robotic systems
- Planning validation and error handling

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Use LLMs to translate natural language tasks into action plans
- Map generated action plans to ROS 2 behaviors
- Implement cognitive planning systems for robotic applications
- Validate and refine action plans generated by LLMs
- Handle planning errors and edge cases

## Topics Covered

This chapter is organized into the following sections:

1. [LLM Task Planning](./llm-task-planning) - Using LLMs to convert natural language to action plans
2. [ROS 2 Mapping](./ros2-mapping) - Mapping plans to ROS 2 behaviors and execution

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, you should have:

- Completed Chapter 1: Voice-to-Action Interfaces
- Understanding of ROS 2 behavior trees or action servers
- Basic knowledge of LLM concepts and APIs
- Familiarity with JSON and structured data processing

## Next Steps

After completing this chapter, you'll have the cognitive planning capabilities needed to create intelligent robotic systems that can understand and execute complex human instructions.
