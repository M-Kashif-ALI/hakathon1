## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Voice Command Processing (Priority: P1)

As an AI/robotics student, I want to understand how to convert voice commands into structured robot actions so that I can build voice-controlled humanoid robots.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational user interaction pattern that enables natural human-robot communication.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by implementing a simple voice command that triggers a robot action and demonstrates the full voice-to-action pipeline.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a humanoid robot with audio input capability, **When** a user speaks a command like "Move forward 2 meters", **Then** the robot processes the speech and executes the corresponding navigation action.

2. **Given** a humanoid robot with audio input capability, **When** a user speaks an invalid command, **Then** the robot provides appropriate feedback indicating it didn't understand.

### User Story 2 - LLM-Based Task Planning (Priority: P2)

As an AI/robotics student, I want to learn how to translate natural language tasks into action plans so that I can create robots that understand complex human instructions.

**Why this priority**: This enables higher-level reasoning and planning capabilities for autonomous robots.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by providing natural language input to an LLM system and verifying it generates appropriate action sequences.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a natural language task description like "Go to the kitchen and bring me a red apple", **When** the LLM processes this input, **Then** it generates a sequence of executable actions for navigation, object recognition, and manipulation.

### User Story 3 - End-to-End VLA Pipeline Integration (Priority: P3)

As an AI/robotics student, I want to understand how all VLA components work together in a complete system so that I can build fully autonomous humanoid robots.

**Why this priority**: This provides the comprehensive understanding needed for building complete autonomous systems.

**Independent Test**: Can be demonstrated by executing a complete scenario that integrates voice input, LLM planning, and robot execution.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a humanoid robot in an environment with objects, **When** a user provides a complex voice command, **Then** the robot successfully processes the command through all VLA components and executes the appropriate sequence of actions.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the LLM generates an impossible action sequence?
- How does the system handle ambiguous voice commands?
- What occurs when the robot encounters unexpected obstacles during navigation?
