# ROS 2 Robotic Nervous System

Welcome to the ROS 2 Robotic Nervous System module. This module covers the fundamental concepts of using ROS 2 as middleware for humanoid robots.

## Overview

This module is designed to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of ROS 2 and how it functions as the "nervous system" for humanoid robots. You'll learn about the architecture, how to control robots using Python, and how to structure humanoid robot models using URDF.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the ROS 2 architecture and its role in robotic systems
- Create and control robot nodes using Python
- Define humanoid robot structures using URDF
- Implement the robotic nervous system for humanoid robots

## Chapters

1. [ROS 2 Architecture](./ros2-architecture/index.md) - Learn about the ROS 2 architecture and its role as middleware for humanoid robots
2. [Python Robot Control](./python-robot-control/index.md) - Master Python-based robot control techniques
3. [URDF Humanoid Structure](./urdf-humanoid-structure/index.md) - Define and structure humanoid robot models using URDF

## Next Modules

After completing this module, continue with:

- **Module 2: Digital Twin** - Learn about creating digital twins for humanoid robots
- **Module 3: Isaac Robot Brain** - Explore the Isaac Robot Brain for advanced AI integration

Begin with the [ROS 2 Architecture](./ros2-architecture/index.md) chapter to start your journey into physical AI and humanoid robotics.
