# Chapter 1: ROS 2 Architecture

Welcome to the first chapter of the ROS 2 Robotic Nervous System documentation. This chapter will introduce you to ROS 2 as the middleware nervous system for humanoid robots, enabling communication, control, and AI-to-robot integration.

## Overview

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) serves as the middleware nervous system for humanoid robots, providing the essential communication infrastructure that enables various robot components to interact seamlessly. This architecture facilitates:

- Communication between different robot subsystems
- Control mechanisms for robot actuators and sensors
- Integration pathways for AI agents
- Coordination of complex robotic behaviors

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will understand:

- The role of ROS 2 in Physical AI
- How nodes, topics, and services enable communication
- Message flow patterns in humanoid robot systems
- The architectural patterns that make ROS 2 suitable for humanoid robotics

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge
- Understanding of robotics concepts (optional but helpful)

## Next Steps

Continue to the next section to learn about the role of ROS 2 in Physical AI.
