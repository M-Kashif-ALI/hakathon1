# Chapter 2: Python Robot Control (rclpy)

This chapter covers how to create ROS 2 nodes using Python's rclpy library, implementing publishing, subscribing, and AI agent integration to control humanoid robots.

## Overview

Python is a primary language for AI and robotics development due to its simplicity, extensive libraries, and strong community support. The rclpy library provides Python bindings for ROS 2, enabling you to create nodes that control humanoid robots, process sensor data, and integrate with AI systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will:

- Understand how to create ROS 2 nodes using rclpy
- Implement publishing and subscribing patterns in Python
- Integrate AI agents with ROS 2 robot control systems
- Apply best practices for Python-based robot control

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge
- Understanding of ROS 2 concepts (covered in Chapter 1)
- Familiarity with object-oriented programming concepts

## Next Steps
