# Chapter 1: Voice-to-Action Interfaces

This chapter covers the foundational component of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems: converting voice commands into structured robot actions. You'll learn how to build voice-controlled humanoid robots by implementing speech recognition and command processing pipelines.

## Overview

Voice-to-action interfaces enable natural human-robot communication by processing spoken commands and converting them into structured robot actions. This chapter focuses on:

- Speech recognition with OpenAI Whisper
- Converting voice commands into structured inputs
- Processing and validating voice commands
- Integrating voice interfaces with robotic systems

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Implement speech recognition using OpenAI Whisper
- Convert natural language voice commands into structured robot actions
- Handle various types of voice commands and their processing
- Validate and process voice commands in a robotic context
- Build a complete voice-to-action pipeline

## Topics Covered

This chapter is organized into the following sections:

1. [Speech Recognition with OpenAI Whisper](./speech-recognition) - Understanding and implementing speech recognition technology
2. [Command Processing](./command-processing) - Converting recognized speech into structured robot commands

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, you should have:

- Basic understanding of ROS 2
- Familiarity with Python programming
- Basic knowledge of audio processing concepts

## Next Steps

After completing this chapter, you'll have a solid foundation in voice-to-action interfaces that you can build upon in the subsequent chapters of this module.
