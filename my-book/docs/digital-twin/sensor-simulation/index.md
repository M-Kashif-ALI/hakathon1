# Chapter 3: Sensor Simulation

This chapter covers LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs simulation with sensor data flow into ROS 2 for humanoid robotics.

## Overview

Sensor simulation is critical for testing perception algorithms, SLAM, navigation, and other AI systems that rely on sensor data. This chapter explores how to simulate various sensors on humanoid robots and integrate the sensor data flow into ROS 2, enabling comprehensive testing without requiring physical sensors.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will:
- Understand how to simulate LiDAR sensors producing realistic point cloud data
