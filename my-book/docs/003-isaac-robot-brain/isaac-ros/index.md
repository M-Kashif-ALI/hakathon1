# Isaac ROS

This chapter covers hardware-accelerated perception pipelines and Visual SLAM using Isaac ROS.

## Overview

Isaac ROS provides a collection of hardware-accelerated perception and navigation packages that extend ROS 2 with GPU-accelerated processing capabilities. These packages enable high-performance robotics applications that leverage NVIDIA's GPU computing platform.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
- Understand Isaac ROS hardware-accelerated perception pipeline architecture
- Implement Visual SLAM solutions using Isaac ROS packages
- Process sensor data efficiently using GPU acceleration
- Compare performance between accelerated and traditional CPU processing
