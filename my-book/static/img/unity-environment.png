# Unity Environment Diagram

This is a placeholder for Unity environment diagrams. In a real implementation, this would be an actual image file showing Unity visualization concepts.

For the purposes of this documentation, we're creating a text file as a placeholder. In a real implementation, this would be replaced with actual diagrams showing:

1. Unity rendering pipeline
2. Human-robot interaction scenarios
3. Environment setup
4. Material and lighting configurations
