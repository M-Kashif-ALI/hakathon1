# Gazebo Simulation Diagram

This is a placeholder for Gazebo simulation diagrams. In a real implementation, this would be an actual image file showing Gazebo simulation concepts.

For the purposes of this documentation, we're creating a text file as a placeholder. In a real implementation, this would be replaced with actual diagrams showing:

1. Gazebo physics simulation environment
2. Robot model in Gazebo world
3. ROS 2 integration architecture
4. Sensor simulation examples
