# UI/UX Component Contracts

## Purpose
This directory would contain API contracts for any backend services or API endpoints used by the UI/UX components. For a static documentation site built with Docusaurus, there are no backend APIs, so this directory serves as a placeholder for the standard project structure.

## Components with Potential API Interactions
- Search functionality (uses Docusaurus built-in search)
- Analytics tracking (if implemented)
- Any future interactive features

## Frontend Contracts
The UI/UX components interact with:
- Docusaurus theme APIs
- React component interfaces
- CSS class interfaces
- Browser APIs for accessibility features
