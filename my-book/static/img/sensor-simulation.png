# Sensor Simulation Diagram

This is a placeholder for sensor simulation diagrams. In a real implementation, this would be an actual image file showing sensor simulation concepts.

For the purposes of this documentation, we're creating a text file as a placeholder. In a real implementation, this would be replaced with actual diagrams showing:

1. LiDAR point cloud generation
2. Depth camera RGB-D data
3. IMU orientation and acceleration
4. Sensor placement on humanoid robot
5. ROS 2 sensor data flow
