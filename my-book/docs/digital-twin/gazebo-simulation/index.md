# Chapter 1: Physics Simulation with Gazebo

This chapter covers physics simulation with Gazebo for humanoid robotics, including gravity, collisions, dynamics, and ROS 2 integration with simulated robots.

## Overview

Gazebo is a powerful physics simulation environment that provides realistic modeling of physical interactions for robotics applications. For humanoid robots, Gazebo enables testing of control algorithms, dynamics, and environmental interactions in a safe, repeatable environment before deploying to real hardware.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will:
- Understand how to configure physics parameters in Gazebo (gravity, friction, collision properties)
- Set up realistic collision and dynamics models for humanoid robots
- Integrate simulated robots with ROS 2 systems for control and monitoring
- Test control algorithms in a physics-accurate environment

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of ROS 2 concepts
- Familiarity with URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- Basic knowledge of physics concepts (gravity, collisions, dynamics)

## Chapter Sections

1. [Physics Concepts in Gazebo](./physics-concepts.md) - Understanding gravity, collisions, and dynamics
2. [ROS 2 Integration with Simulated Robots](./ros2-integration.md) - Connecting simulation with ROS 2 systems

## Next Steps

Continue to the next sections to learn about physics concepts and ROS 2 integration in Gazebo.
