# Chapter 3: Humanoid Structure with URDF

This chapter covers URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for defining humanoid robot structure, explaining links, joints, and kinematics for both simulation and control purposes.

## Overview

URDF is the standard format for representing robot models in ROS. For humanoid robots, URDF defines the physical structure including links (rigid parts), joints (connections between parts), and their kinematic relationships. This description is essential for both simulation and real robot control.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will:

- Understand the structure of URDF files for humanoid robots
- Define links, joints, and their properties
- Implement kinematic chains for humanoid structures
- Use URDF in both simulation and control contexts

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of robot kinematics basics
- Familiarity with ROS 2 concepts (covered in Chapter 1)
- Basic XML knowledge (URDF is XML-based)

## Next Steps

Continue to the next section to learn about URDF links and joints.
