## Prompt


## Response snapshot

Successfully generated comprehensive implementation tasks for the UI/UX upgrade of the Docusaurus documentation site. Created a detailed tasks.md file with 60 specific tasks organized across 7 phases: Setup, Foundational Design System, and four user stories (Enhanced Reading Experience, Intuitive Navigation, Modern Visual Design, and Responsive Design). Tasks follow the required checklist format with sequential IDs, story labels, and specific file paths. The implementation strategy prioritizes an MVP focusing on User Story 1 (Enhanced Reading Experience) with clear dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified. All tasks are designed to be independently executable while building toward the complete UI/UX upgrade.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Comprehensive task list created for UI/UX implementation
- 🧪 Tests: Tasks organized by user stories with independent test criteria
- 📁 Files: 1 task file created
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation with `/sp.implement`
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully organized complex UI/UX work into actionable tasks

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): All tasks follow required format
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementation with MVP tasks
